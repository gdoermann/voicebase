### Contributing code to voicebase

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that it follows these guidelines:

* Limit yourself to one feature or bug fix per pull request.
* Include unittests that thoroughly test the feature/bug fix
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
* Many granular commits are preferred over large monolithic commits
* If you're adding or modifying features, please update the documentation

If you're working on a big ticket item, please check in with Greg (we will add a user group if wanted).
We'd hate to have to steer you in a different direction after you've already put in a lot of hard work.
